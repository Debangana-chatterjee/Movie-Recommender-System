## üß† How it works
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Done in MovieRecommenderSystem.ipynb using:

- Genre, cast, crew, keywords, overview, etc.

- Combined into a single text feature

- Transformed using CountVectorizer and cosine similarity

**Recommendation Logic**
In app.py:

- Loads movie_list.pkl and similarity.pkl

- On user selection, retrieves top 5 similar movies

- Uses TMDb API to fetch posters

**User Interface**
Built with Streamlit:

- Dropdown to select movies

- Button to get recommendations

- Grid layout showing titles + posters
